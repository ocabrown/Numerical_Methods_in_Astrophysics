Here you will find Python projects which have been inspired by the book Numerical Methods in Astrophysics by P. Bodenheimer, et al.
Each project will cover a different numerical method.


## Internal Viscosity (Numerical Diffusion)

This simple solution (1st order) to the 1D continuity equation demonstrates the effect of internal viscosity spreading an initial discontinuity into smooth, broad ramps as time passes. (Here, v = 100 and ∆t = 0.002 = one fifth the stability limit of ∆x/v)!
